# schrodingerFD
Simulates the schrodinger equation using finite difference method in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions and animates the simulation.

The program can simulate time evolution of any initial condition and any potential as long as it only depent on the 
position.

To carry out a simulation spesify the values you would like for the simulation in a textfile with a spesial format. 
'freeElectron1D.txt' gives an simple example of this format, and describe the format of the file.
The textfile 'initialStatesAndPotentials.txt' describes what initial states and potential are available and what 
extra values these needs.

Then run the 'schrodinger.out' program and type in the name of this textfile as input.
If there exists a directory with the same name as this file then all files produced by 'schrodinger.out' is placed in
this directory.

This simulation can then be animated by running 'plotSchrodinger.py' which produces a movie placed in the 
'simulationMovies' directory. One need ffmpeg to make this movie. If one does not have ffmpeg, it is still possible
to plot the simulation making a minor change as descibed in 'plotSchrodinger.py'.

For mac (and probably linux) users one can simply run runSimAndAnimate.sh and type in the name of the textfile with 
the values to simulate, to both run the simulation, animate it and start the movie with quicktime player.

One can make new initial states and potentials in the 'Schrodinger.cpp' file found in 'sourceFilesSchrodingerFD'
under setV() and makeInitState(). Remember to add them to the 'initialStatesAndPotentials.txt'
