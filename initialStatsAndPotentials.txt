// This file lists all the initial states and potentials available for schrodingerFD to
// simulate and the extra parameters these need.
// The initial states and potential are sorted after number of dimensions.
// For a detailed understanding of the initial states and potentials have a look in the
// source code of schrodingerFD in Schrodinger.cpp under makeInitState() and setV().
// Necessary extra parameters are listed with a '-' under the initial state or potential.
// # is used to make a comment about the parameter or name of initial state or potential.
