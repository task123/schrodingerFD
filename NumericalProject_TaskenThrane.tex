\begin{abstract}
We have written a program that integrates the Schr\"{o}dinger equation numerically, thereby finding how a system evolves given a time independent potential and an initial state. The solution works both for one and two dimensional systems.
\end{abstract}

\section{The program}
The program is composed of two major parts, schrodin-gerFD and plotSchrodinger.py. schrodingerFD is implemented using C++, and is used to make the initial state, determine the time evolution of the system by integrating the Schr\"{o}dinger equation using finite differences, as well as saving these results in certain files. plotSchrodinger.py is implemented in python, and is used to make an animated movie of the progress of the system\cite{jake}. In addition to these programs, there are several .txt files that are needed to run a simulation; also, several shell scripts have been made to automate the process. For information on how to run a simulation, see README.md\footnote{Note that to run plotSchrodinger.py as included, ffmpeg must be installed. An alternative is to modify plotSchrodinger.py as described in the code.}. All of these files should be included with this document, but can also be found at \url{https://github.com/task123/schrodingerFD}.

\section{Results}
The program works well for the different conditions tested, and can easily be expanded to include new potentials and initial conditions. To view the results of a few simulations, a couple of output .mp4 files have been placed in the subdirectory simulationMovies. For the specific situations described in problem 4 and 5 in \cite{exercise}, the probability of reflection and transmission was calculated for varying potential height and width, respectively. The results are shown in figure \ref{oppg4} and \ref{oppg5}.
